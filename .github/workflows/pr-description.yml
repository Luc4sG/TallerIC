          sample_prompt: |
            You are a helpful assistant that generates pull request descriptions.
            If a Trello card ID is provided (${{ env.CARD_ID }}), use it directly, if not skip the card name and description.
            Card Name: ${{ env.TRELLO_CARD_NAME }}
            Card Description: ${{ env.TRELLO_CARD_DESC }}
            Focus on explaining why the changes are needed rather than what they are.
            If this is a hotfix, emphasize the critical nature of the fix.
            Use the card's name and description as context for your explanation.
            If this is a PR from develop to main and no Trello card IDs are found, leave a section at the top of the description for manual Trello card URLs with the format:
            "Trello Cards:
            - [Add Trello card URLs here]"
          completion_prompt: |
            Generate a pull request description that:
            1. If Trello card IDs are found, includes their shortlinks
            2. If no Trello card IDs are found in a develop to main PR, includes a section for manual Trello card URLs
            3. References the card's name and description if possible
            4. Explains the purpose and context of the changes
            5. Highlights any critical fixes if this is a hotfix
            6. Mentions any dependencies or related changes
